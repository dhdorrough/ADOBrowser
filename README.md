This program can be used to Browse any table that can be accessed using a “connection string”.

Any table that can be accessed via a Connection String can be opened. 

Records can be presented ordered by any available index.
Records can be searched for a string appearing in any field. Additional records can be added and any records can be hidden (i.e., marked as deleted).
Double-clicking on a “(MEMO)” field will open it in a separate window.
